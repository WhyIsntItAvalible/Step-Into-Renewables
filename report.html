  <h1>Report and Summary - Renewables Website</h1>
  <p>During the creation of our website, we worked hard to complete it but faced many, many problems.
    The main problem that our team faced when creating our website was when our elected website designer
    chose to code the website himself using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. He chose to do this because it 
    would give him more access and opportunities which other website designers (Such as Wix) could not provide.
    During this project we also faced a lot of time pressure; this was due to a lack of time management and a 
    lot more work that other groups did not face. We used many dissimilar sources for information on solar 
    panels and images and used many different websites for getting help and information when something went
    wrong in the code of the website.</p>
