  <h1>Climate Change. The Answer?</h1>
  <h2>Renewables.</h2>
  <h4>So what actually are 'Renewables', and why do we need them so desperately?</h4>
  <h6>Here is a quick video to show you how important renewables really are.</h6>

  <h4>What are Renewables?</h4>
  <p>Renewable energy is a type of energy that naturally replenishes itself faster than it can be used. Commonly used
    examples of these energy sources are wind, solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal. The reason many people are choosing
    more renewable sources of energy are because overall it will be much more ecofriendly, the fuel will never run out
    and cheaper electricity. Non-renewable types of energy that we use are coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear.
    Non-renewable types of energy are different to renewable energy as they will not naturally replenish themselves for
    hundreds of thousands or even millions of years.</p>

  <h4>Is it ture that Australia has the most solar panels in the world?</h4>
  <p>Within South Australia over 308 000 homes have solar panels, which is roughly 40% of South Australian homes.
    Lithium-ion batteries are also usually installed with solar panels. During the day when solar panels are generating
    electricity, the electricity may not be being used and they would then start charging the batteries. This would then
    allow you to use that electricity during a time when the sun is not out. For example, a cloudy day or at night.
    Australia is leading the world with the most solar panels per capita, with over 2.68 million . The reason a
    substantial percentage of Australians have solar panels compared to other countries is because of the Australian
    climate, being the hottest continent in the world. Australia is very exposed to the sun which means that solar
    panels are more effective at generating electricity, making them a better investment for your home.</p>
