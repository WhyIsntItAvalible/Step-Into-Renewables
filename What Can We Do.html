  <h1>What Can We Do To Help?</h1>
  <h4>What will this technology look like in 10-20 years time?</h4>
  <p>At the moment, not a lot. We can still do things like plaacing more solar panels on our houses or trying to stop
  using one-use paper bags. But aside from that, not much. We can pressure our goverments and communities into trying
  to make more action towards climate change, and they will hopefully try and take the next step towards fully
  renewable energy.</p>

  <h4>What will this technology look like in 10-20 years time?</h4>
  <p>The future of electricity generating will hopefully see the eradication of <img src="/Images/farm.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" height="200">all non-renewable fuel sources but
    instead see more wind, tidal and solar farms. Obviously non-renewables are not going to be 100% gone by tomorrow
    morning, but we are seeing a dramatic change in where electricity has been coming from over the past 10-20 years.
    Solar panels are an incredibly worthwhile investment for your house in the long run as they are one of many steps
    to stopping climate change and will also help you save a bit of money.</p>

  <h4>To top things off, what have we learnt?</h4>
  <p>During this inquiry we have investigated many things about solar panels and lithium-ion batteries. We have
    investigated how solar panels can transform light into electricity and how lithium batteries can store that
    electricity. We have also investigated the benefits of solar panels and their lithium batteries as and additional
    to a home as well as what might be holding back the production of this technology. </p>
